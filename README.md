# Synheat model
* The Synheat model is proposed by Yee and Grossmann, and the original is written on the GAMS platform.
* This model is built based on a stage-wise superstructure and can be used to design a large-scale heat exchanger network.
* This is my first try to write an MINLP model of the chemical PSE problem in JuMP, hope it can be helpful to other beginners who are willing to do research related to chemical process optimization in Julia.
