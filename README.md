# Synheat model
* The Synheat model was proposed by Yee and Grossmann in 1990, and the original model code is written on the GAMS platform.
* This model is built based on a stage-wise superstructure and can be used to design cost-optimal  heat exchanger network.
* This is my first attempt to build a MINLP model of the chemical PSE problem in JuMP, I hope it can be helpful to other beginners who are willing to do research related to chemical process optimization in Julia.
